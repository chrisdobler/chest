This is an organization app, which focuses on fast input, so you would tag
posessions fast and efficiently. Quick dumps of items are saved for later review.

Later, when you go back and review, you could add meta data like tags and text
descriptions. Again the whole focus is quick and efficient data entry which would
be a photo and location minimum.
